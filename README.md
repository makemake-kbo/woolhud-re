This is a continuation of woolhud made by [this TFTV user](https://www.teamfortress.tv/user/76561198258717546), a hud heavily inspired by a woolen sleevlet's hud. 
THIS IS NOT HIS HUD DO NOT ASK HIM QUESTIONS IF THE HUD IS BROKEN!!! SUBMIT AN ISSUE OR A PATCH!!!   
It has some minor diffrences from the original woolhud, but everything is mostly the same.
## Transparent viewmodels
This hud is ready to use for transparent viewmodels. Grab the required files from my [tf2conf repository](https://github.com/makemake-kbo/tf2config) to use them. If you need additional help check [this video out on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsWPW817xWY).    
**ONLY WORKS ON DXLEVEL 9**


# Important information
This HUD is *for the 16:9 aspect ration ONLY*. If you have a monitor of any other aspect ratio you must set the in-game ratio to 16:9 to use this hud. I am working on supporing 4:3 amd 16:10! Hang tight!
DO NOT remove any file from this hud exept readme or sound!
