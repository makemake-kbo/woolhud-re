This is a continuation of woolhud made by [this TFTV user](https://www.teamfortress.tv/user/76561198258717546), a hud heavily inspired by a woolen sleevlet's hud. 
THIS IS NOT HIS HUD DO NOT ASK HIM QUESTIONS IF THE HUD IS BROKEN!!! SUBMIT AN ISSUE OR A PATCH!!!   
It has some minor diffrences from the original woolhud, but everything is mostly the same.
## Transparent viewmodels
This hud is ready to use for transparent viewmodels. Grab the required files from my [tf2conf repository](https://github.com/makemake-kbo/tf2config) to use them. If you need additional help check [this video out on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsWPW817xWY).
